## About this Oracle Globally Distributed Database repository

This repository provides deployment automation and tools for Oracle Database using Oracle Globally Distributed Database. It includes the following:

* Terraform based deployment of Oracle Globally Distributed Database.
* Mid-tier routing for use in Oracle Globally Distributed Database applications.
* OKE based deployment of Oracle Globally Distributed Database database.
* Fast data ingest for sharding applications.

To learn more about Oracle Globally Distributed Database (also referred to as Oracle Sharded Database), review the [product page][SDB-prod-page] and [product documentation][SDB-prod-doc].

<strong> Note </strong> : Globally Distributed Database, Oracle Sharding, Sharded database, and Oracle Sharded Database (SDB) are interchangeably used names in the documentation and refer to the same entity. 

 
## Terraform based deployment of Oracle Globally Distributed Database

### Overview  

The `SDB-terraform-oci` and `SDB-terraform-onprem` deployments provide Terraform modules, configuration and scripts that provision the necessary components and resources for a quick and easy setup of [Oracle Globally Distributed Database][SDB] (SDB) on either [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][OCI] (OCI) or as an On-Premises (`onprem`) database. These deployments create and configures SDB infrastructure components that are necessary for a successful Globally Distributed Database setup, including Oracle Shard Directors, Shard Catalogs, Shards, and optionally, Shard Standbys. It also provides replication through a recovery catalog standby database using Oracle Data Guard. Oracle Data Guard provides both high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) for data in the Globally Distributed Database.

### Details

For more details, see the [SDB-Terraform][SDB-terraform] documentation.

## Mid-tier routing for use in Oracle Globally Distributed Database client applications

### Overview

For an overview of the mid-tier Oracle Globally Distributed Database feature, see the Globally Distributed Database [Mid-Tier Routing introduction][MTR-Intro].

### Details

To learn more about the Oracle Globally Distributed Database features for mid-tier, see: [SDB Mid-Tier routing][SDB-Mid-Tier-Routing].

## OKE-based deployment of Oracle Globally Distributed Database 

### Overview 

The OKE deployment provides Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)-based deployment of an Oracle Globally Distributed Database.

### Details

To learn more about the OKE sharding feature, see: [OKE sharding][OKE-sharding] documentation.

## Container-based deployment of Oracle Globally Distributed Database 

### Overview 

Oracle provides deployment tools for container-based deployment of Globally Distributed Database.

### Details

To learn more about container-based deployment of Oracle Globally Distributed Database, see: [Container sharding](./container-based-sharding-deployment/README.md).

## Fast data ingest

### Overview

The Fast data ingest library consists of several parts:
 * Generic routing table interfaces
 * Sharding metadata implementation
 * Metadata reader (encapsulated select queries)
 * Tools for efficient parallel splitting with respect to sharding key

### Details

To learn more about the Oracle Sharding Fast Data Ingest feature, see: [Fast data ingest][SDB-Fast-Data-Ingest].
