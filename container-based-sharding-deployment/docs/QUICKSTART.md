# Oracle Globally Distributed Database Container QuickStart Guide

Use this quickstart to help you deploy Oracle Globally Distributed Database with the RAFT Replication feature enabled using Podman Containers on a single Oracle Linux Host machine using Podman Compose.

This deployment uses Oracle Globally Distributed Database Container Image and bridge network driver for Podman.

## Before you begin
- Before proceeding further, prepare the Podman host by completing prerequisites related to the Oracle Globally Distributed Database Containers on Podman host environment as explained in [Preparation Steps for running Oracle Globally Distributed Database Database in containers](../README.md#preparation-steps-for-running-oracle-globally-distributed-database-in-linux-containers). Oracle provides a precreated script, `setup_gdd_host.sh`, which will prepare the Podman host with the following prerequisites-
    - Validate Host machine for supported Os version(OL >8), Kernel(>UEKR6), Memory(>32GB), etc.
    - Install Podman
    - Install Podman Compose
    - Setup and Load SELinux modules
    - Create Oracle Globally Distributed Database Podman secrets
- Set `secret-password` of your choice below, which is going to be used as a password for the Oracle Globally Distributed Database Container environment.

  Run the following command- 
  ```bash
  export SHARDING_SECRET=<secret-password>
  ``` 
- To prepare the Podman host machine using a precreated script, copy the file `setup_gdd_host.sh` from [<GITHUB_REPO_CLONED_PATH>/db-sharding/container-based-sharding-deployment/containerfiles/setup_gdd_host.sh](../containerfiles/setup_gdd_host.sh) and run the following command -

  ```bash
  ./setup_gdd_host.sh -prepare-sharding-env
  ```
  Logs-
  ```bash
  INFO: Finished setting up the pre-requisites for Podman-Host
  ``` 
- In this quickstart, our working directory is `<GITHUB_REPO_CLONED_PATH>/db-sharding/container-based-sharding-deployment/containerfiles` from where all commands are run.

## Getting Oracle Globally Distributed Database Container Images
- Refer to the [Getting Oracle Globally Distributed Database Container Images](../README.md#building-oracle-globally-distributed-database-container-images) section to get Oracle Globally Distributed Database Container Images used in quickstart setup.  
- When Podman images are ready, such as is shown in this example used in this quickstart, you can proceed to the next steps-
  ```bash
  # podman images
  REPOSITORY                                               TAG                 IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
  localhost/oracle/database-ext-sharding                   23.5.0-ee           1c17b71b710e  21 hours ago  7.06 GB

  ```
## Networking in Oracle Globally Distributed Database Podman Container Environment
- In this Quick Start, we will create the following subnets for Oracle Globally Distributed Database Podman Container Environment-  

  | Network Name   | Subnet CIDR         | Description                          |
  |----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
  | shard_pub1_nw    | 10.0.20.0/20 | Public network for Oracle lobally Distributed Database Podman Container Environment|

## Deploy Oracle Globally Distributed Database on Podman Container Environment
- Copy the `podman-compose.yml` file from this [<GITHUB_REPO_CLONED_PATH>/db-sharding/container-based-sharding-deployment/samples/compose-files/podman-compose.yml](../samples/compose-files/podman-compose.yml) in your working directory.

  ```bash
  source ./setup_gdd_host.sh -export-sharding-env
  ```
