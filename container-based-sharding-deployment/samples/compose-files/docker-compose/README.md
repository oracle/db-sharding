# Deploying Oracle Globally Distributed Database Containers using docker-compose

This document provides an example of how to use `docker-compose` to create the Docker network and to create the containers for an Oracle Globally Distributed Database Deployment on a single Oracle Linux 7 host using Docker Containers.

**IMPORTANT:** This example uses 21c RDBMS and 21c GSM Docker Images.

## Install Docker Compose
```bash
DOCKER_CONFIG=${DOCKER_CONFIG:-$HOME/.docker}
mkdir -p $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
ls -lrt $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.23.1/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
ls -lrt $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
chmod +x $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

## Complete the prerequisite steps

Use the file [docker-compose-prerequisites.sh](./docker-compose-prerequisites.sh) to export the environment variables, create the network host file, and create required directories.

**NOTE:** Change the values for `SIDB_IMAGE` and `GSM_IMAGE` to use the images that you want to use for the deployment.

```bash
source docker-compose-env-variables
```

Use the following commands to create an encrypted password file:

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure the version of `openssl` in the Oracle Database and Oracle GSM images is compatible with the `openssl` version on the machine where you will run the openssl commands to generated the encrypted password file during the deployment.

```bash
rm -rf /opt/.secrets/
mkdir /opt/.secrets/
openssl genrsa -out /opt/.secrets/key.pem
openssl rsa -in /opt/.secrets/key.pem -out /opt/.secrets/key.pub -pubout

# Edit the file /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt to add the password string
vi /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt

# Encrypt the file having the password
openssl pkeyutl -in /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt -out /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.enc -pubin -inkey /opt/.secrets/key.pub -encrypt

rm -f /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt
chown 54321:54321 /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.enc
chown 54321:54321 /opt/.secrets/key.pem
chown 54321:54321 /opt/.secrets/key.pub
chmod 400 /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.enc
chmod 400 /opt/.secrets/key.pem
chmod 400 /opt/.secrets/key.pub
```

## Create Docker Compose file 

Copy a Docker Compose file named [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yml) in your working directory.


## Create services using "docker compose" command
After you have successfully completed the prerequisties for deployment, run these commands to create the services:
```bash
# Switch to location with the `docker-compose.yaml` file and run:
 
docker compose up -d
``` 

## Check the logs

```bash
# You can monitor the logs for all the containers using below command:
 
docker compose logs -f
```

Wait for all the Docker setup processes to complete, and each component indicates that it is up and ready. For example:
```
# docker compose up -d

- First export all the variables from the Prerequisites Sesion.
- Use the following command to remove the deployment:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
