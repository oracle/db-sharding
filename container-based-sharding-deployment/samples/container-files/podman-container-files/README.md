## Prerequisites

You must complete all of the prerequisites before deploying an Oracle Globally Distributed Database using Podman Containers. These prerequisites include creating the Docker network, creating the encrypted file with secrets, and other steps required before deployment. 


### Network Management

Before creating a container, create the podman network by creating the Podman network bridge based on your environment. If you are using the bridge name with the network subnet mentioned in this README.md, then you can use the same IPs mentioned in the [Deploy Oracle Globally Distributed Database Containers](#create-containers) section.

#### Macvlan Network

To create a Podman network with `macvlan` driver, run the following command:

```bash
podman network create -d macvlan --subnet=10.0.20.0/24 --gateway=10.0.20.1 -o parent=ens5 shard_pub1_nw
```

#### Ipvlan Network

To create a Podman network with `ipvlan` driver, run the following command:

```bash
podman network create -d ipvlan --subnet=10.0.20.0/24 --gateway=10.0.20.1 -o parent=ens5 shard_pub1_nw
```

If you are planning to create a test environment within a single machine, then you can use a Podman bridge. However, these IPs will not be reachable on the user network.

#### Bridge Network

To create a podman network with `bridge` driver, run the following command:

```bash
podman network create --driver=bridge --subnet=10.0.20.0/24 shard_pub1_nw
```

**Note:** You can change subnet and choose one of the above mentioned podman network bridge based on your environment.

### Setup Hostfile

**Note:** You can skip this step of creating a Hostfile when you are using a DNS for the IP resolution.

All containers will share a host file for name resolution.  The shared hostfile must be available to all containers. Create the empty shared host file (if it doesn't exist) at `/opt/containers/shard_host_file`:

For example:

```bash
mkdir /opt/containers
rm -rf /opt/containers/shard_host_file && touch /opt/containers/shard_host_file
```

Because Oracle Database Containers do not have root access to modify the `/etc/hosts` file, add the following host entries in `/opt/containers/shard_host_file`. This file must be prepopulated. You can change these entries based on your environment and network setup.

```text
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain           localhost
10.0.20.100     oshard-gsm1.example.com         oshard-gsm1
10.0.20.101     oshard-gsm2.example.com         oshard-gsm2
10.0.20.102     oshard-catalog-0.example.com    oshard-catalog-0
10.0.20.103     oshard1-0.example.com           oshard1-0
10.0.20.104     oshard2-0.example.com           oshard2-0
10.0.20.105     oshard3-0.example.com           oshard3-0
10.0.20.106     oshard4-0.example.com           oshard4-0
```

### Password Management

* Specify the secret volume for resetting database user passwords during catalog and shard setup. The secret volume can be a shared volume among all the containers

  ```bash
  mkdir /opt/.secrets/
  cd /opt/.secrets
  openssl genrsa -out key.pem
  openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pub -pubout
  ```

* Edit the `/opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt` and seed the password. The password will be common for all the database users. Run the following command:

  ```bash
  vi /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt
  ```
  **Note**: Enter your secure password in the pwdfile.txt file and save the file.

* After seeding password and saving the `/opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt` file, run the following command:
  ```bash
  openssl pkeyutl -in /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt -out /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.enc -pubin -inkey /opt/.secrets/key.pub -encrypt
  rm -rf /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.txt
  ```
  Oracle recommends using Podman secrets inside the containers. Run the following command to create the Podman secrets:
  
  ```bash
  podman secret create pwdsecret /opt/.secrets/pwdfile.enc
  podman secret create keysecret /opt/.secrets/key.pem

  podman secret ls
  ID                         NAME        DRIVER      CREATED        UPDATED
  547eed65c01d525bc2b4cebd9  keysecret   file        8 seconds ago  8 seconds ago
  8ad6e8e519c26e9234dbcf60a  pwdsecret   file        8 seconds ago  8 seconds ago
  ```

**Note:** This password and key secrets are used for initial Oracle Globally Distributed Database topology setup. After the Oracle Globally Distributed Database topology setup is completed, you must change the topology passwords based on your enviornment.

## SELinux Configuration on Podman Host
To run Podman containers in an environment with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, you must configure an SELinux policy for the containers. To check if your SELinux is enabled or not, run the `getenforce` command.
With SELinux, you must set a policy to implement permissions for your containers. If you do not configure a policy module for your containers, then they can end up restarting indefinitely, or generate other permission errors. You must add all Podman host nodes for your cluster to the policy module `shard-podman`, by installing the necessary packages and creating a type enforcement file (designated by the `.te` suffix) to build the policy, and load the policy into the system. 

In the following example, the Podman host `podman-host` is configured in the SELinux policy module `shard-podman`: 

Copy [shard-podman.te](../../../containerfiles/shard-podman.te) to `/var/opt` folder in your host and then execute below-
```bash
cd /var/opt
make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile shard-podman.pp
semodule -i shard-podman.pp
semodule -l | grep shard-pod
```
## Deploy Oracle Globally Distributed Database Containers
